I'm a student who enjoys coding. I've
spent years creating open-source
and proprietary corporate software. I
began as a hobby programmer,
which led me to pursue a formal
computer science education, create
many open-source programs, and
then shift into an internship role,
where I played an integral part in the
development of industry-standard
applications.
